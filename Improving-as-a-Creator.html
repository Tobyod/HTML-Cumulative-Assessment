          Things to Take Note of When Creating in Geometry Dash
        </h2>
        <h3 style="color: white">What to do When Starting Out</h3>
        <p style="color: white">
          When starting out creating in Geometry Dash can be frusterating and
          confusing. I heavily recommend when first learning you familiarize
          yourself with the level editor using <u>tutorials</u>. Tutorials can
          teach you valuable skills such as how to decorate structures the
          player interacts with in game and how to create effects that can be
          used in levels. Another thing I highly recommend doing is joining
          discord geometry dash creation server. This will not only be an
          excellent source of feedback, but also a great way to make friends.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: white">Taking Inspiration From Other Creators</h3>
        <p style="color: white">
          I would recommend trying to take inspiration from other creators in
          the game. This is because other people have incredible ideas you can
          try to imitate in order to learn to produce a better level.
