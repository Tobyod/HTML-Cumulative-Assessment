          How to Rapidly Improve Your Geometry Dash Playing skill
        </h2>
        <h3 style="color: white">Things to Consider When Starting Out</h3>
        <p style="color: white">
          Players in Geometry Dash can generally split into one of three
          categories those being star grinders (players who focus on playing a
          bunch of levels approved by the game's developer), demon grinders
          (players who focus on beating levels with the hardest difficulty in
          the game, which is known as demon) and challenge players (players who
          focus on playing incredibly difficult short levels).
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: white">What is the fastest way to improve?</h3>
        <p style="color: white">
          The best way to improve at playing the game is to be a
          <em>challenge player</em>
          by playing a bunch of challenges. Because Challenges have some of the
          hardest gameplay in any level due to their short length they are by
          far the best way for new players to rapidly improve. Another
          incredibly useful tool to improve is demon, and challenge progression
          lists. These lists clearly show which levels you should practice to
          improve in game skills, and give a clear route of progression for
          newer players.
